# FIRE-Up
FIRE Up is a mobile app that allows you to work towards financial independence, tracking your progress and telling you the steps to reach your monetary goals! Users enter in their retirement goals (age, spending, etc.), and FIRE Up provides them with the path to get there.

FIRE = Financial Independence, Retire Early

* Separate assets (stocks, bonds, cash) by allocation percentage and return percentage, then calculate FIRE output
* Provide in-app resources, blog posts, and articles about the pros and cons (return and risk) of different asset categories by age
* Suggest yearly spending decreases to user (“if you decrease your yearly spending by X, then you can retire Y years earlier”)
